# Introduction

This is a sample post demonstrating the Tufte CSS style in Jekyll. Tufte CSS provides tools for web typography, including side notes, margin notes, and margin figures.

## Side Notes

Here's a sentence with a side note.[^1] Side notes appear in the margin.

[^1]: This is a side note.

## Margin Notes

Here's a sentence with a margin note.{^mn-id}

{^mn-id}: This is a margin note. It's similar to a side note but doesn't have a number.

## Margin Figures

This paragraph has a margin figure. Margin figures can be used to display images, charts, or other visual elements in the margin.

## Math Support

When `math: true` is set in the front matter or `_config.yml`, you can use LaTeX for equations:

$$
\phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}
$$

## Conclusion

This is just a brief example of what you can do with Tufte CSS in Jekyll. Experiment with different elements to create beautifully typeset web pages. -->
