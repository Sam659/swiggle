Talking to computers is inefficient bc it's always been inefficient. What if I described X vs showed you X. That's why tools like photoshop and Figma got invented, bc we can't describe shit with words.

Why are we trying to use text now?

Can you imagine designing stuff (house, math, website) with words?

Can you imagine enjoying X with just words?

A picture is worth 1000 words.

We created tools so we don't have to use text? Text makes it really hard to build shit, to enjoy shit.

Creative tools are designed for the artist, AI tools are designed to fit the model.
