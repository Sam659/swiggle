Professionals love using creative tools like photoshop, but they’re complicated to use. New AI image generation tools are fast and creative but they can't do 99% of what professional tools can do because they don’t have creative control.

These image generation tools rely soley on text input, disconnecting the creative from their art.

Can you imagine designing a house, website, or artwork with just words?

Text alone is missing something. It's missing the creative touch artists bring—that take their work from good to great.

We're building the future of AI creative tools. Taking artists out of the black box and bringing them closer to their work.
